## General Information
- This repo contains a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.
- I want to develop a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- I am using a dataset which consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

## Technologies Used
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- CNN

## Conclusions
- The model is trained for classifying an image into below 9 diseases
  Actinic keratosis
  Basal cell carcinoma
  Dermatofibroma
  Melanoma
  Nevus
  Pigmented benign keratosis
  Seborrheic keratosis
  Squamous cell carcinoma
  Vascular lesion
